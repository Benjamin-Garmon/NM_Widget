# NM_Widget
more of a script than a widget. I use this on my iPhone through Pyto. 
This script shows how much saline to add to a dose so that I can use 1 drop to have the required radioactivity needed for daily 7 a.m. quality control on our gamma cameras.
Like all things in nuclear, it is not always exact but does get close enough to be able to use
